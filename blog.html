    I have spent most of today and much of yesterday taking the Udemy 2019 Web Developers Bootcamp. I’ve completed both the intro and intermediate courses for HTML and CSS. I’d say at this point I am equiped.
    <br>
    Begin equipped is different that being skilled. Now I need to practice what I learned so it begins to stick. Then I will know what many know today. The difference will be the skill level. How to know to do things, how to do it well, and how to do
    it quickly. So I will pause and practice what I learned by doing the following:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Get my Software Portfolio completed and published on github.</li>
      <li>Get my draft of On The Street, design it and begin to build it.</li>
      <li>Get my draft of On The Street, design it and begin to build it.</li>
      <li>Get my blog working better</li>
    </ul>
    So this evening, I will watch the Warriors and see if they can live on in the championships against the Raptors. Then I will spend time on the items listed above. I hope I can get this done done tonight, or at least by tomorrow afternoon.

    It’s a Sunday, and I am going through the 2019 Web Development Bootcamp - Udemy. So far it has helped me a lot. It is very basic and fundamental but the speaker, Angela Yu has a pleasant enough voice and is clear and interesting in her speech.
    So, I am learning to be a software developer using the industry standard tools. I have made it through intro and intermediate HTML. Now I am on intro CSS. I hope today I can complete the CSS training. The next lesson is on debugging.

    I had to erase and re install my IMac in order to get my appleid to work. So tonight I retook the beginning course in Udemy again (~2 hrs) so I could recreate the projects. Oh yes, I did sign up for the Udemy 2019 Web Development Bootcamp. 10$.
    As I recreated everything, I was better able to organize my desktop. It turned out to be a fortunate restart. I am going to try to get through the course quickly. I am enjoying it.
    <br>
    Also, the iMac was slow after loading so many programs so I bit the bullet and shelled out 180$ for a ful 32gb memory upgrade. It seems to be helping so far. This machine is not all that fast...but I am not experiencing painful sluggishness with
    view playback now.
    <br>
    It’s possible I am spinning my wheels. I am concerned about the amount of time I will need to spend at the computer. My eyes are so great anymore and the ergonomics of the keyboard and mouse are already effecting me a bit.

    I don’t know why yesterday that I kept thinking was the Coding Dojo 3 hour intro. It’s tonight. Maybe I was anxious to go. Anyway, that means I didn’t miss the Warriors get beat up by the Raptors. 2 games to 1 now.
    <br>
    I need to bring a laptop to the class. My macbook is so slow I am not sure I will be able to keep up. I find these macs, both desktop and laptop very uncomfortable. Not a good thing if I am planning to spend a lot of time on them.
    <br>
    I feel I have scratched the surface enough on HTML/CSS/Javascript and even Nodejs and web3, But a scratch is only what it is. I am giving myself a goal by end of year to have dug in deep on these skills.
    <br>
    I think today, it is not so untrue to say, that everyone should learn to code. It becomes a natural form of communications I think after a while. And there is some much potential and opportunity why would one not to join in the fun.

    Today I will go interview at a temporary agency for work. My enemployment runs out soon. Will need to keep some income going. Maybe check with Cecelia about getting dividend payments.
    <br>
    Yesterday I watched the 10 principles of sovereign identity by Chris Allen. I feel like I am now up to date on the whole identity topic now in regards to my software development project of creating an identity wallet for homeless people on the
    blockchain. This evening I will be going to Coding Dojo in Berkeley for an immersive intro to full stack web development. 3 hours. I’ll see how tha all goes!
    <br>
    I had a great shower idea for a video to sell my project. I will create a skit and get actors to portray them using the app the keep their identity. A short, ~15 min video. Of course, I will not have written any app. But this will help gauge
    interest and see if it has any wings. That is, are people interested in the idea and potential to help homeless people.
    <br>
    This keyboard for the iMac is the most uncomfortable keyboard. Need to fix it!

    As I was setting up my development environment on this IMac, I was starting to get asked, as I joined one devleoper tool or another, and especially when I joined github, I would get asked , what did I want to call this?
    <br>
    So, I came up with a new name, a brand. BCAdventures. Which is short for Block Chain Adventures. So that is that.
    <br>
    Now, I am going to run out of unemployment is less than two weeks. I looked in to EDD where , if I took training, I could have my unemployment checks extended. I’ve been getting $1800 per month for the last 6 months. I have decided not to pursue
    that course anymore. So my income drops to zero then. I am still good with my severance from KP and I have decided to train myself or perhaps pay for some training. I might take the Udemy Web Developer bootcamp course. I will go to an onsite
    place, Codeing Dojo in Berkeley on thursday to have 3 hour intro.
    <br>
    In the meantime, I have been studying the identity management world. So, there is this thing called sovereign identity. Where you are in control of your own identity, no one else. There are a few implementations, with serveral blockchain
    implementations attempting to achieve this goal. There is criteria to meet which I am not quite clear on yet.
    <br>
    So I continue to learn in a sporadic fashion. Some blockchain tutorials, Javascript programming, Then some articles about homeless demographics. Occasionally going down rabbit holes as google starts to target my interests and supply me with
    clickbaitable links. I guess we humans are kind of like fish!
    <br>
    I am going to try to make more lists and document more, hence these daily chronicles. If I an to do this, I will need to be disciplined.

    I am seriously considering a foray back into software development. I am not sure I was ever really good at it before, but I did enjoy it. It seems like a good baby boomer occupation. Work that can be done anywhere.
    <br>
    I was trained in the cobol programming language as well as 370 Assembly language, a very low level a language. I remember the power I felt after writing and compiling code that would have the computer do my bidding. Or at least , without being
    dramatic, it was satisfying work. The need to build and see your creation come to life!
    <br>
    So, I am going to begin to chronicle here in this document, which is journal or blog style at best, my way into software development. It all started with a brilliant idea I had. That idea was to develop a distributed application that ran on the
    ethereum blockchain which would track the identity of homeless individuals.
    <br>
    Anytime I think I have a great idea I check the oracle to see if anyone else has had this same idea. And in this case, some had thought of putting the identies of homeless individuals on the blockchaing! This initiative orginated in Austin, TX
    (https://coincentral.com/how-blockchain-can-help-the-homeless/)
    <br>
    So, I am not skilled or have great knowledge on using the blockchain. My programming skills are over a decade old, in other words obsolete. So I set about updating my skills in programming and blockchain...and in the homeless problem. I look at
    the latter as the carrot hanging on the stick. This is what I really want to accomplish. This is my goal. This is what will hold my interest.
    <br>
    So this morning I looked into the matter of digital identity and the blockchain. To see if this has been solved or implemented in any other way. And of course, yes...and whole new world to me opened up and I have more study to do. There are a
    few publications I need to take in (THe Path to Sel-Sovereign Identity.) And this is an organization I need to learn more about ID2020.org
    <br>
    I will have my work cut out for me if I continue pursuing this dream. I ask myself if I am too old. I know I don’t learn as fast as I once did. My memory is not as sharp. Can I keep up? I don’t dwell on that too much but I need to recognize it
    as a weakness. Especially when I am trying to sell myself in the job market.
    <br>
    Anyway, I am starting this chronicle to help me better organize my activities and progress. I actually started this some weeks ago. I basically found myself delving into this in my alone and free time. So I figured, being unemployed, why not
    make a go of it. I have come to understand the environment I would be getting into by doing the following
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking youtube tutorials</li>
      <li>Blockchain: Ethereum, smart contracts</li>
      <li>Programming tools: javascript, HTML5/CSS, solidity</li>
      <li>Created a development desktop to help me learn and do programming</li>
      <li>Bought 27” Imac 580$</li>
      <li>Setup bookmarks to developer information and enrolled in blockchain utilities and Github.</li>
      <li>Thinking about end goal and how to market myself</li>
      <li>Blockchain full stack developer</li>
      <li>Software Developer portfolio</li>
      <li>My first project, and Identity system for homeless people</li>
      <li>Tutorial projects</li>
      <li>Get certificate from udemey</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>

    This is where I am at today. I ad looked into extending my unemployment benefits by enrolling in approved training. However, I was not keen on the training course. I’ll go it alone. I am hoping by the end of 2019, I will resemble a software
    developer.
